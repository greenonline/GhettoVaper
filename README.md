# GhettoVaper

 I decided to extend the GhettoVape sketch, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXBiAZ-3UqU, which was posted by Julian Loiacono (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCguKFNSIUiugIYAus0rarOg). The original code is here: https://github.com/jcloiacon/ghettovape-III

Makes use of modified versions of the mButton library files ([mButton.cpp](https://github.com/markfickett/bicycle/blob/master/MomentaryButton.cpp)/[mButton.h](https://github.com/markfickett/bicycle/blob/master/MomentaryButton.h)) which can be found in [bicycle](https://github.com/markfickett/bicycle) by [Mark Fickett](https://github.com/markfickett).
