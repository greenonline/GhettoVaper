# GhettoVaper

 I decided to extend the GhettoVape sketch, see [YouTube:The GhettoVape III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXBiAZ-3UqU), which was posted by [Julian Loiacono](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCguKFNSIUiugIYAus0rarOg). The original code is here: [Github:jcloiacon/ghettovape-III](https://github.com/jcloiacon/ghettovape-III).
 
For more information, see [GhettoVaper - an extended GhettoVape III](https://gr33nonline.wordpress.com/2017/07/23/ghettovape-iii-extended/).


Makes use of modified versions of the mButton library files ([mButton.cpp](https://github.com/markfickett/bicycle/blob/master/MomentaryButton.cpp)/[mButton.h](https://github.com/markfickett/bicycle/blob/master/MomentaryButton.h)) which can be found in [bicycle](https://github.com/markfickett/bicycle) by [Mark Fickett](https://github.com/markfickett).

If using the 0.91" OLED display, you need to use [SSD1306_Extended_Char](https://github.com/greenonline/SSD1306_Extended_Char) library, which inherits [U8g2 lib](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino)

Uses LiquidCrystalFast library for the 1602 LCD display, on [CodeBender](https://codebender.cc/library/LiquidCrystalFast)

Uses [TFT_ILI9163C_Extended_Char](https://github.com/greenonline/TFT_ILI9163C_Extended_Char) library for the 1.44' OLED colour display
